            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Odyssey is an epic poem written by Homer, a famous Greek poet, that speaks of 
                Odysseus' 10-year struggle to return home to his family after the Trojan War. While Odysseus faces the wrath of the Greek gods and battles mystical creatures, his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, reject suitors who would like Penelope's
                hand in marriage in order to claim the throne of Ithaca.</p>
